# Shoot-em-up-game

Steer your ship with the arrow keys. 
Shoot enemy ships with space. 
Collect golds and diamonds to gain scores. 
Try to catch a transparent box for protection from the blue beams, which otherwise may kill you. 
Sometimes you will face a large enemy ship. These are hard to kill, but gives a lot of scores. 
Watchout! Do never shoot on your allied ships (the ones looking like your own one).
It is also possible to save your game and load an old one.
